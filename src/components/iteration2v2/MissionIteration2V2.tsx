              We didn't build Paritee to chase size. We built it to deliver the impact you deserve — 
              with trust, purpose and partnership at the core and most importantly, customized to your needs.
            </p>

              You won't find hierarchies or holding company politics here.
              You'll find equals — independent agencies with aligned values, coming together to solve real challenges 
              with sharp thinking and shared ambition.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Our name, Paritee, is rooted in the idea of parity.
              It reflects what we believe: Great things happen when equals come together.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-white">
              Each of our agencies is a recognized leader in its market — strong individually, even stronger together.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              You get seamless delivery, sharper thinking, and results without the baggage of big networks 
              or the limits of small shops.
